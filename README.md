### Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

- This command will create a production-ready build of the application in the build folder.
- The build process optimizes the code for performance and minifies it to reduce file size.
- The resulting build is suitable for deployment to a web server or hosting platform.

### Ejecting (Advanced Configuration)

**Note:** Ejecting is a one-way operation and should be done with caution. It gives you full control over the configuration files and dependencies, but it's irreversible.

To eject from the default configuration and gain full control over the build tool and configuration choices, use the following command:

```
npm run eject
```
